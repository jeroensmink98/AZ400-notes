# Azure CLI

Azure CLI is a command-line program you use to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands on Azure resources.

Azure CLI provides cross-platform command-line tools for managing Azure resources.

You can install it locally on computers running the Linux, macOS, or Windows operating systems.

You can also use Azure CLI from a browser through Azure Cloud Shell.

In both cases, you can use Azure CLI interactively or through scripts:

Interactive. For Windows operating systems, launch a shell such as cmd.exe, or for Linux or macOS, use Bash. Then issue the command at the shell prompt.
Scripted. Assemble the Azure CLI commands into a shell script using the script syntax of your chosen shell, and then execute the script.
